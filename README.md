# Uni_Status
This is an executable script that I'm using to give me information about my university admission status.

I find that I waste too much time checking my status and Universities tend to be late sending their emails

At the moment, it only scrapes+parses for OUAC, but I will eventually integrate the CommonApp or CoalitionApp

Instructions for use:
1) In terminal (mac) type: pip3 install requests
2) Then: pip3 install bs4
3) Download my script
4) In terminal type "chmod +x "
5) Drag OUACStatus.command file into terminal and hit enter
Now it's an executable file, so whenever you double-click it, it will run.
