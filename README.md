# Uni_Status
This is an executable script that I'm using to give me information about my university admission status.
It uniquely scrapes the OUAC website for offers of admission and returns a status: offer or pending.

I find that I waste too much time checking my status and Universities tend to be late sending their emails

Instructions for use:
1) In terminal (mac) type:
  (a) pip3 install requests
  (b) pip3 install bs4
2)Download my script
3) In terminal type "chmod +x "
4) Drag OUACStatus.command file into terminal and hit enter
Now it's an executable file, so whenever you double-click it, it will run.
